I found that the main takeaways emphasised appear to be in their definition of good content, which according to them is:</p><ul><li>Appropriate</li><li>Clear</li><li>Friendly</li><li>Useful</li></ul><p>Also, while reading through their guidelines on grammar and mechanics, I came across a tip which resonated with me for writing content:</p><blockquote><p>When in doubt, read your writing out loud</p></blockquote><p>It sounds straight-forward, but I can see this being useful and ringing true throughout the course of the project. It seems like as long as there&rsquo;s some established principles and content is read aloud, you&rsquo;ll be able to determine whether it&rsquo;s casting the right mood or not.</p><p>MailChimp&rsquo;s voice and tone is also confident, informative, and casually engages their customers, providing encouragement and a sense of accomplishment once any task has been completed. It&rsquo;s full of hidden delight, and they&rsquo;re also not afraid to throw a bit of humour into the mix!</p><p><img src="/images/2016-03-13-design-languages-pattern-libraries/mailchimp-voice-tone.jpg" alt="MailChimp Voice &amp; Tone"><figcaption>MailChimp Voice &amp; Tone</figcaption></p><p>After reading through what MailChimp has to offer, I&rsquo;ve decided to follow a similar approach and have drafted some content principles to keep in mind while developing my designs:</p><ul><li>Light-hearted</li><li>Informative</li><li>Human</li><li>To-the-point</li></ul><p>While the wording of these is subject to change, it provides a manner to be conscious of while designing.</p><h3 id="yelp-styleguide">Yelp Styleguide</h3><p>Unlike MailChimp, Yelp&rsquo;s styleguide doesn&rsquo;t contain a whole lot of detail regarding how to write content, but it does it provide plenty of insight and usage guidelines into patterns, both basic and complex, and visual elements such as typography, colour, and layout.</p><p><img src="/images/2016-03-13-design-languages-pattern-libraries/yelp-styleguide.png" alt="Yelp styleguide"><figcaption>Yelp Styleguide</figcaption></p><p>The assets that Yelp has documented all appear clear, simple, and fit for purpose. The colour palette they use is stripped-down to the very essentials but contains just the right amount of fun, without getting in the way of application&rsquo;s primary experience.</p><p>Moving forward, I&rsquo;m going to play by Yelp&rsquo;s example, and apply bright, clear, and engaging aesthetics to my designs without distracting the user from their task at hand.</p><h3 id="prototyping-and-visual-design-tools">Prototyping and visual design tools</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve also spent some time online researching a number of prototyping and visual design tools to use, in particular <a href="http://www.adobe.com/ie/products/experience-design.html" target="_blank">Adobe Experience Design CC</a>, <a href="http://framerjs.com/" target="_blank">Framer</a>, and <a href="https://proto.io/" target="_blank">proto.io</a>.</p><p>As I already have experience with <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">Sketch</a> and <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank">InVision</a>, and as Experience Design is fresh to the market, I figured I&rsquo;d use this as an opportunity to really put it to the test. It provides the ability to design and prototype interactive applications from scratch using the familiarity of Creative Cloud&rsquo;s toolset, with the claim of live previews and simple sharing. It also boasts integration with Adobe Illustrator to import higher-quality assets, a tool I&rsquo;m not up-to-scratch with and had been looking for an opportunity to improve my skills in.</p><p>Though Framer and proto.io seem to have a good support for dynamic elements, maybe more so than Adobe Experience Design, their learning curves seemed far higher in comparison.</p><h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3><p>In the next post, I&rsquo;ll look at gaining empathy for those exposed to the current gig-finding experience. The topics I&rsquo;ll cover will include proto-personas, identifying any issues with the current scenario, and experience and scenario mapping via storyboarding.</p><h3 id="resources">Resources</h3><ul><li><a href="http://www.cooper.com/prototyping-tools" target="_blank">Prototyping Tools</a></li><li><a href="http://styleguides.io/" target="_blank">Style Guide Resources</a></li></ul><footer><div class="previous-post"><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/06/introduction/" title="Introduction">Previous post</a></div><div class="next-post"><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/20/gaining-empathy/" title="Gaining Empathy">Next post</a></div></footer></article></main><aside><h3>Posts</h3><ol class="posts"><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/04/17/high-fidelity-solution/" title="Apr 17, 2016">High-fidelity solution</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/04/10/universal-inclusive-design-accessibility/" title="Apr 10, 2016">Universal (inclusive) design and accessibility</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/04/03/cognitive-social-psychology/" title="Apr 3, 2016">Cognitive and social psychology</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/27/information-architecture-content-strategy/" title="Mar 27, 2016">Information Architecture and Content Strategy</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/20/gaining-empathy/" title="Mar 20, 2016">Gaining Empathy</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/13/design-languages-pattern-libraries/" title="Mar 13, 2016">Design Languages and Pattern Libraries</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/06/introduction/" title="Mar 6, 2016">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="/markdown/2016/03/05/markdown/" title="Mar 5, 2016">Markdown</a></li></ol><h3>Links</h3><ul class="links"><li><a href="http://github.com/simonfinney" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzA9UyHASmcNRjFEWjltV3M5cEE&usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Drive</a></li><li><a href="http://twitter.com/SimonJFinney" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li></ul></aside></body></html>
