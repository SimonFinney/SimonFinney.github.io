I also had a look at creating a rough persona for the project, as a means of quickly building empathy with our user, and developing a likely scenario in which they might use the product.</p><h3>Pain points</h3><p>Trying to proactively figure out what&rsquo;s on in the city every week is extremely time consuming, and if you&rsquo;re not constantly at it, things can almost always slip under the radar.</p><p>Below are some samples from <a href="http://www.mcd.ie/listings/" target=_blank>MCD.ie</a> and <a href=http://www.tickets.ie/events.aspx/category/Music/1 target=_blank>Tickets.ie</a>, highlighting some of the issues that plague gig listing websites today:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-03-20-gaining-empathy/MCD.ie.png alt=MCD.ie><figcaption>MCD.ie</figcaption></p><p>MCD.ie makes it pretty difficult to discover upcoming gigs:</p><ul><li>Everything is in-your-face — it&rsquo;s a classic case of information overload</li><li>Flexible filtering options are nowhere to be seen</li></ul><p>Tickets.ie, while slightly better than MCD, still lacks in many regards:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-03-20-gaining-empathy/Tickets.ie.png alt=Tickets.ie><figcaption>Tickets.ie</figcaption></p><ul><li>Filtering can only occur one genre at a time — good luck to anyone trying to filter by date or their location productively!</li><li>There&rsquo;s no way to focus on what I&rsquo;m interested in or what&rsquo;s happening near me</li><li>How do I stop missing out on gigs that I really want to attend?</li></ul><p>With the above pain points in mind, I took a first pass at developing a proto-persona that captures the needs of what I believe is a typical user.</p><h3>Meet Eoin</h3><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzA9UyHASmcNNlhldnFENlJOUmc" target=_blank>Eoin</a> is an ideal representation for the issues outlined above — he represents someone who could use the product both casually and on-the-spot, when he&rsquo;s looking for something to do.</p><p>The artifacts were generated over a period of an hour using an <a href=https://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/themes/dschool/method-cards/empathy-map.pdf target=_blank>empathy mapping</a> exercise, as a means of quickly placing myself in my user&rsquo;s shoes to understand their pains and opportunities. From here, I borrowed some formatting guidelines (Gothelf &amp; Seiden, 2013), such as demographic information, and goals and pain points to develop a best guess as to who exactly is using these products and why.</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-03-20-gaining-empathy/Empathy-map.jpg alt="Empathy map"><figcaption>Empathy map</figcaption></p><p>Once I had an idea of who Eoin is, I began brainstorming how his typical scenario and narrative may be, via experience mapping and storyboarding.</p><h3>Experience mapping and storyboarding</h3><p>Using the empathy map and persona, I produced a basic experience map that would outline the scenario of Eoin attempting to discover a gig for the weekend.</p><p>Mapping out the experience helped me understand the possible settings in which the current applications are used (Cooper, Cronin, &amp; Reimann, 2007).</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-03-20-gaining-empathy/Experience-map.jpg alt="Experience map"><figcaption>Experience map</figcaption></p><p>From here I used storyboarding as a means of understanding the current scenario better. Storyboarding would help communicate opportunities and pain points by telling a user-centric story, as well as provide a narrative I could use when producing screencasts.</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-03-20-gaining-empathy/Storyboard.jpg alt=Storyboard><figcaption>Storyboard</figcaption></p><p>The final scenario and storyboard ended up as the following:</p><ol><li>Eoin&rsquo;s boarding a bus on his way home from work on a Friday evening and he&rsquo;s hoping to do something one night over the weekend</li><li>Once he manages to get a seat, he takes his phone out and begins looking for gigs on tonight</li><li>He opens up a number of different things - social networks to see if his friends are attending anything, and ticketing website he frequently accesses to get a complete picture of what may be going on</li><li>When he&rsquo;s looking through the websites, he has to navigate through each of the categories one-by-one, wishing there was a more efficient way of doing this</li><li>With so much happening across the country, he&rsquo;s only really interested in what&rsquo;s happening in his current city or what&rsquo;s near him, and he only cares about bands he&rsquo;s interested in</li><li>When he does eventually find something he might be interested in, he discovers it&rsquo;s sold out! He&rsquo;s annoyed he didn&rsquo;t find out about that sooner, otherwise he definitely would&rsquo;ve went</li><li>He painstakingly continues his search until he discovers something he might enjoy</li></ol><h3>Next steps</h3><p>With a groundwork seeded in empathy, and a draft visual tone finally in place, I can move forward with applying key theories from psychology to improve the current experience.</p><h3>References</h3><ul><li>Cooper, A., Cronin, D., &amp; Reimann, R.
