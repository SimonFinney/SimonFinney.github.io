As a result, I&rsquo;ve created a project plan which can be accessed <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cslYNdrI2uEUQJJxMyQ1FbJkkaDBW0eMrTyV0VlHwAM/edit?usp=sharing" target=_blank>here</a>. This outlines both the research and tasks I intend on conducting over the course of the next month, along with some provisional dates in place to ensure I remain on track.</p><h3 id=next-steps>Next steps</h3><p>In the next post, I&rsquo;ll discuss some of the design languages, and pattern libraries I&rsquo;ll be researching, as well as the prototype and visual design platforms I intend on using.</p><h3 id=resources>Resources</h3><ul><li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target=_blank>Jekyll - Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cslYNdrI2uEUQJJxMyQ1FbJkkaDBW0eMrTyV0VlHwAM/edit?usp=sharing" target=_blank>Project plan</a></li></ul><footer><div class=next-post><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/13/design-languages-pattern-libraries/" title="Design Languages and Pattern Libraries">Next post</a></div></footer></article></main><aside><h3>Posts</h3><ol class=posts><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/04/17/high-fidelity-solution/" title="Apr 17, 2016">High-fidelity solution</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/04/10/universal-inclusive-design-accessibility/" title="Apr 10, 2016">Universal (inclusive) design and accessibility</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/04/03/cognitive-social-psychology/" title="Apr 3, 2016">Cognitive and social psychology</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/27/information-architecture-content-strategy/" title="Mar 27, 2016">Information Architecture and Content Strategy</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/20/gaining-empathy/" title="Mar 20, 2016">Gaining Empathy</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/13/design-languages-pattern-libraries/" title="Mar 13, 2016">Design Languages and Pattern Libraries</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/06/introduction/" title="Mar 6, 2016">Introduction</a></li></ol><h3>Links</h3><ul class=links><li><a href=http://github.com/simonfinney target=_blank>GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzA9UyHASmcNRjFEWjltV3M5cEE&usp=sharing" target=_blank>Google Drive</a></li><li><a href=http://twitter.com/SimonJFinney target=_blank>Twitter</a></li></ul></aside><script src=/assets/javascript/main.min.6a32ec35.js></script></body></html>
