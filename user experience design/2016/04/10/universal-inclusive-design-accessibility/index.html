You would think it would be in their best interest to take this on board, but in my experiences this isn&rsquo;t always the case!</p><p>Below I&rsquo;ve outlined some of the principles defined by the Center for Universal Design (1997) with regards to the current website, and provided recommendations for how these can be improved and implemented in my designs going forward.</p><h4 id=equitable-use>Equitable Use</h4><p>Equitable use is concerned with ensuring a design is both useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities. It&rsquo;s guidelines are as follows:</p><ul><li>1a. Provide the same means of use for all users: identical whenever possible; equivalent when not</li><li>1b. Avoid segregating or stigmatising any users</li><li>1c. Provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally available to all users</li><li>1d. Make the design appealing to all users</li></ul><p>Currently <a href=# target=_blank>Tickets.ie</a> has a very limited colour palette (Numerous levels of grey and orange) which may not drastically affect users with colour blindness. If we invert the colours, we can also see that it performs for those sensitive to brightness, and easier to distinguish for those suffering from colour blindness:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-10-universal-inclusive-design-accessibility/Tickets.ie_Equitable-Use.png alt="Equitable Use - Problem"><figcaption>Equitable Use - Problem</figcaption></p><p>The most apparent issue lies in the distinguishability of links from other copy on the website, although the persistent monochromatic tones may render certain aspects of the website indistinguishable from others.</p><p>We can see how <a href=http://www.yelp.com/dublin target=_blank>Yelp</a> have accommodated for those with deuteranopia, a common form of colour blindness, by integrating a limited but effective colour palette to differentiate between different sections and navigation elements.</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-10-universal-inclusive-design-accessibility/Yelp_Equitable-Use.png alt="Equitable Use - Solution"><figcaption>Equitable Use - Solution</figcaption></p><p>The final design will address the above issues by providing clear differentiation between navigation and copy through the use of type, the assistance of iconography, and the use of contrasting colours to differentiate separate sections.</p><h4 id=flexibility-in-use>Flexibility in Use</h4><p>Flexibility in use refers to a design accommodating a a wide range of individual preferences and abilities. The recommended guidelines for this context are:</p><ul><li>2a. Provide choice in methods of use</li><li>2b. Accommodate right or left-handed access and use</li><li>2c. Facilitate the user&rsquo;s accuracy and precision</li><li>2d. Provide adaptability to the user&rsquo;s pace</li></ul><p>Tickets.ie in it&rsquo;s current form, doesn&rsquo;t provide a whole lot of flexibility in terms of filtering down or sorting search results:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-03-20-gaining-empathy/Tickets.ie.png alt="Flexibility in Use"><figcaption>Flexibility in Use - Problem</figcaption></p><p>Providing flexibile filtering controls would allow the target audience choice in the methods they use, and pivot easily within their context at their own pace.</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-10-universal-inclusive-design-accessibility/Flexibility-in-Use.jpg alt="Flexibility in Use"><figcaption>Flexibility in Use - Solution</figcaption></p><h4 id=simple-and-intuitive-use>Simple and Intuitive Use</h4><p>It&rsquo;s also important that a design is easy to understand, regardless of the user&rsquo;s experience or knowledge:</p><ul><li>3a. Eliminate unnecessary complexity</li><li>3b. Be consistent with user expectations and intuition</li><li>3c. Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills</li><li>3d. Arrange information consistent with its importance</li><li>3e. Provide effective prompting and feedback during and after task completion</li></ul><p>The current website, as discussed in previous posts, operates in a funnel, and has appalling navigation between artists, events, and venues, a standard of which any web user expects today.</p><p>As addressed in my post on <a href=/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/27/information-architecture-content-strategy/#information-architecture>information architecture and content strategy</a>, it&rsquo;s intended that the target audience will be able to manipulate the event listings purely by toggling on and off options of their choice, and users should be able to freely navigate between artists, events, and venues without getting trapped.</p><h4 id=size-and-space-for-approach-and-use>Size and Space for Approach and Use</h4><p>The final principle is concerned with providing appropriate size and space when using a product, regardless of a user&rsquo;s body size, posture, or mobility:</p><ul><li>7a. Provide a clear line of sight to important elements for any seated or standing user</li><li>7b. Make reach to all components comfortable for any seated or standing user</li><li>7c. Accommodate variations in hand and grip size</li><li>7d. Provide adequate space for the use of assistive devices or personal assistance</li></ul><p>The current Tickets.ie website is not optimised for mobile use, so therefore can be tricky to navigate while on a smartphone - the target audience would have to jump through hoops to view anything on the website, in particular pinching to zoom to access individual elements on the page and any specific controls or functionality.</p><p>Regardless of left or right-handed users, any task would be difficult to achieve:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-10-universal-inclusive-design-accessibility/Tickets.ie_Size-Space-Approach-Use.png alt="Size and Space for Approach and Use - Problem"><figcaption>Size and Space for Approach and Use - Problem</figcaption></p><p>In an effort to minimise fatigue for the current website on mobile, I&rsquo;ve drafted a quick solution below:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-10-universal-inclusive-design-accessibility/Size-Space-Approach-Use.jpg alt="Size and Space for Approach and Use - Solution"><figcaption>Size and Space for Approach and Use - Solution</figcaption></p><p>Key actions such as filtering and searching appear towards the bottom of the screen closer to the user, as floating action buttons - if these were located at the top of the screen, it may be hard to reach depending on whether you&rsquo;re left or right-handed.</p><p>Switching between views would appear under the section&rsquo;s header as tabbed navigation - While this requires some effort, it&rsquo;s not completely out of reach for either handed individual.</p><p>Finally, the events for selection are displayed as cards in a descending, scrollable list - this is more than suitable for anyone to manipulate and select the item they require.</p><p>Now that I&rsquo;ve addressed how some of the principles of universal design can be applied to my designs, I&rsquo;ll speak briefly about accessibility and how it can be considered in any web application.</p><h3 id=accessibility>Accessibility</h3><p>To develop a modern software application that integrates advanced user interface controls and dynamic content, that&rsquo;s effectively accessible to users who rely on assistive technology such as screen readers, <a href=https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria target=_blank>Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite (WAI-ARIA)</a> is employed (Cooper, 2016).</p><p>To meet the criteria for accessibility standards, the current website was scanned using an accessibility policy tester, against a number of guidelines:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-10-universal-inclusive-design-accessibility/Tickets.ie_Policy-testing.png alt="Accessibility policy testing"><figcaption>Accessibility policy testing</figcaption></p><p>The results were astonishing - On one section of the website, there were <strong>113 violations</strong> alone! These varied from severe violations like how the structure of certain elements on the page would prevent screen readers from navigating successfully throughout the content, to missing significant attributes on media and navigation elements that provide screen readers with valuable content descriptions for those with visual impairments.</p><p>If you’re not suffering from a colour vision deficiency, it can be pretty hard to imagine what it looks like to be colour blind. Visual impairments can vary in severity, from colour vision deficiency which prevents those that live with it to identify change in colour (Miller, 2016), to those who can&rsquo;t discern any content, and rely on screen readers as their main interface with an application.</p><p>While my final prototype will show a proof-of-concept and not go as far as fully engineering the application, below are a number of recommendations I&rsquo;ve suggested for improvement:</p><ul><li>Text alternatives should be provided for any non-text content</li><li>Ensure semantic HTML document structure is provided to allow screen readers navigate naturally throughout the document</li><li>Make the contrast between colour of text and it&rsquo;s background distinguishable and legible</li></ul><p>With the last of considerations aside, I can continue with the design production process and finally start building!</p><h3 id=next-steps>Next steps</h3><p>My next post will detail the production process of my design and prototype using Adobe Illustrator and Experience Design - I&rsquo;ll walk through the typical flow for Eoin, our primary user, and incorporate all of the artifacts I&rsquo;ve produced so far.</p><h3 id=references>References</h3><ul><li>Cooper, M.
