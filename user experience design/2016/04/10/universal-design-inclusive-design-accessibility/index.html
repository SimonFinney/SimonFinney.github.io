You would think it would be in their best interest to take this on board, but in my experiences this isn&rsquo;t always the case.</p><p>Below I&rsquo;ve outlined the principles defined by the Center for Universal Design (1997) with regards to the current website, and provided recommendations for how these can be improved.</p><h4>Equitable Use</h4><p>Equitable use is concerned with ensuring a design is both useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities. It&rsquo;s guidelines are as follows:</p><ul><li>1a. Provide the same means of use for all users: identical whenever possible; equivalent when not</li><li>1b. Avoid segregating or stigmatising any users</li><li>1c. Provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally available to all users</li><li>1d. Make the design appealing to all users</li></ul><h4>Flexibility in Use</h4><p>Flexibility in use refers to a design accommodating a a wide range of individual preferences and abilities:</p><ul><li>2a. Provide choice in methods of use</li><li>2b. Accommodate right or left-handed access and use</li><li>2c. Facilitate the user&rsquo;s accuracy and precision</li><li>2d. Provide adaptability to the user&rsquo;s pace</li></ul><p>Currently <a href=# target=_blank>Tickets.ie</a> doesn&rsquo;t provide a whole lot in terms of filtering down search results.</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-03-20-gaining-empathy/Tickets.ie.png alt="Flexibility in Use"><figcaption>Flexibility in Use</figcaption></p><h4>Simple and Intuitive Use</h4><p>It&rsquo;s also important that a design is easy to understand, regardless of the user&rsquo;s experience or knowledge:</p><ul><li>3a. Eliminate unnecessary complexity</li><li>3b. Be consistent with user expectations and intuition</li><li>3c. Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills</li><li>3d. Arrange information consistent with its importance</li><li>3e. Provide effective prompting and feedback during and after task completion</li></ul><h4>Perceptible Information</h4><p>This principle states that all necessary information in a design is communicated effectively, regardless of environmental conditions or user&rsquo;s sensory abilities. It&rsquo;s guidelines are as follows:</p><ul><li>4a. Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, or tactile) for redundant presentation of essential information</li><li>4b. Provide adequate contrast between essential information and its surroundings</li><li>4c. Maximise legibility of essential information</li><li>4d. Differentiate elements in ways that can be described</li><li>4e. Provide compatibility with a variety of techniques or devices used by people with sensory limitations</li></ul><h4>Tolerance for Error</h4><p>The fifth principle aims to minimise hazards or severe consequences of unintenional actions:</p><ul><li>5a. Arrange elements to minimise hazards and errors: most used elements, most accessible; hazardous elements eliminated, isolated, or shielded</li><li>5b. Provide warnings of hazards and errors</li><li>5c. Provide fail safe features</li><li>5d. Discourage unconscious action in tasks that require vigilance</li></ul><h4>Low Physical Effort</h4><p>Anybody using a product or service should be able to use it comfortably and efficiently with minimal fatigue:</p><ul><li>6a. Allow user to maintain a neutral body position</li><li>6b. Use reasonable operating forces</li><li>6c. Minimise repetitive actions</li><li>6d. Minimise sustained physical effort</li></ul><h4>Size and Space for Approach and Use</h4><p>The final principle is concerned with providing appropriate size and space when using a product, regardless of a user&rsquo;s body size, posture, or mobility:</p><ul><li>7a. Provide a clear line of sight to important elements for any seated or standing user</li><li>7b. Make reach to all components comfortable for any seated or standing user</li><li>7c. Accommodate variations in hand and grip size</li><li>7d. Provide adequate space for the use of assistive devices or personal assistance</li></ul><h4>How do these impact on user experience?</h4><h4>Identified concepts</h4><h4>Rationale for choosing concepts</h4><h4>How they&rsquo;re applied</h4><h3>Accessibility</h3><p>To develop a modern software application that integrates advanced user interface controls and dynamic content, that&rsquo;s effectively accessible to users who rely on assistive technology such as screen readers, <a href=https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria target=_blank>Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite (WAI-ARIA)</a> is employed (Cooper, 2016).</p><p>To meet the criteria for accessibility standards, the current website was scanned using an accessibility policy tester, against a number of guidelines:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-10-universal-design-inclusive-design-accessibility/Tickets.ie_Policy-testing.png alt="Accessibility policy testing"><figcaption>Accessibility policy testing</figcaption></p><p>The results were astonishing - On one section of the website, there were <strong>113 violations</strong> alone! These varied from severe violations like how the structure of certain elements on the page would prevent screen readers from navigating successfully throughout the content, to missing significant attributes on media and navigation elements that provide screen readers with valuable content descriptions for those with visual impairments.</p><p>Visual impairments can vary in severity, from colour vision deficiency which prevents those that live with it to identify change in colour (Miller, 2016), to those who can&rsquo;t discern any content, and rely on screen readers as their main interface with an application.</p><p>If youâ€™re not suffering from a colour vision deficiency, it can be pretty hard to imagine what it looks like to be colour blind.</p><p>While my final prototype will show a proof-of-concept and not go as far as fully engineering the application, below are a number of recommendations I&rsquo;ve suggested for improvement:</p><ul><li>Text alternatives should be provided for any non-text content</li><li>Ensure semantic HTML document structure is provided to allow screen readers navigate naturally throughout the document</li><li>Make the contrast between colour of text and it&rsquo;s background distinguishable and legible</li></ul><p>If you&rsquo;re not suffering from a colour vision deficiency, it can be pretty hard to imagine how it looks like to be colour blind.</p><h3>Next steps</h3><p>My next post will detail the production process of my design and prototype, including the user flow, and the scree</p><h3>References</h3><ul><li>Cooper, M.
