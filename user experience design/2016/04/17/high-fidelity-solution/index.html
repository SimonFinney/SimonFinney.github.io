In an effort to illustrate the groundwork of design language and pattern library research, information architecture and content strategy, cognitive and social psychology, and universal design and accessibility, I&rsquo;ve produced a prototype that incorporates a number of these considerations.</p><p>As a learning challenge for myself, I decided to use some tools that I wasn&rsquo;t too familiar with, Adobe Experience Design and Illustrator, in an effort to try them out and determine whether I&rsquo;d use them on other projects in future.</p><h3 id=proposed-user-flow>Proposed user flow</h3><p>My first task was to develop a user flow that I felt was suitable for my primary persona, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzA9UyHASmcNNlhldnFENlJOUmc" target=_blank>Eoin</a>, and the <a href=/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/20/gaining-empathy/#experience-mapping-and-storyboarding>experience mapping and storyboarding</a> exercises I conducted in my previous post on gaining empathy.</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-17-high-fidelity-solution/User-flow.jpg alt="User flow"><figcaption>User flow</figcaption></p><p>The final user flow is as follows:</p><ol><li>Upon opening the application, Eoin&rsquo;s able to see recommendations based on his friends, location, and musical interests</li><li>To discover what&rsquo;s happening this weekend, he opens the filters and selects the correct dates</li><li>Once the filtered results roll in, he selects an event that interests him</li><li>He&rsquo;s able to view information about this event, and scrolls down</li><li>He sees which artists are supporting and which of his friends are attending</li><li>Finally, he&rsquo;s able to compare the price of tickets and navigate to the vendor of his choosing</li></ol><p>Once decided on the basic flow, I took the opportunity to develop a general aesthetic guideline for the outputted designs.</p><h3 id=design-languages-and-pattern-libraries>Design Languages and Pattern Libraries</h3><p>As I made the decision early on to develop the prototype to be used on a smartphone, I inevitably ended up conforming to Google&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html target=_blank>material design</a> guidelines in places, incorporating appropriate interface elements where necessary to ensure the application felt right.</p><p>However, as discussed in my post on <a href=/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/13/design-languages-pattern-libraries/#yelp-styleguide>design languages and pattern libraries</a>, I also wanted to apply bright, clear, and engaging aesthetics to the designs without distracting the audience from their current task.</p><p>I developed a very minimal colour palette, similar in simplicity to that of Yelp&rsquo;s, that was specific and fit-for-purpose across the application:</p><ul><li><strong>Primary colour:</strong> #4178be - Used for primary actions such as navigation</li><li><strong>Primary colour:</strong> #e71d32 - Dominant background colour</li><li><strong>Secondary colour:</strong> #4b8400 - Reserved for special actions like discovering prices</li></ul><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-17-high-fidelity-solution/Colour-palette.png alt="Colour palette"><figcaption>Colour palette</figcaption></p><p>The filter button present on the landing view shows how I adapted the <a href=https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons-floating-action-button.html target=_blank>Floating Action Button</a> of material design to fall in line with the colour palette I adopted:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-17-high-fidelity-solution/Filter.png alt=Filter><figcaption>Filter</figcaption></p><p>In order to maintain it&rsquo;s own style as an application regardless of what platform it may be on, I made a decision to opt-out of using Roboto as a typeface, and instead use the classic Helvetica with a number of different weights.</p><p>Now I&rsquo;ll look at how the information architecture and content strategy developed earlier on fits in with my proposed solution.</p><h3 id=information-architecture-and-content-strategy>Information Architecture and Content Strategy</h3><p>I produced a number of design artifacts while auditing <a href=http://www.tickets.ie target=_blank>Tickets.ie</a> with regards to information architecture and content strategy.</p><p>Although I never fully realised high-fidelity interfaces for individual artists and venues, the links between these sections remain for efficient navigation. The metadata described in the proposed <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RkLuzMdiFI6pFTV3tAWfy5JzLK2fJIKnDQ" target=_blank>content model and entity relationship diagram</a> rings true across my final design.</p><p>Looking back at my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CeML0_uEil-w-kM94HQg14zjiE_zuyzQ9Tv-YYDUjRU" target=_blank>core sample content audit</a>, I also addressed the following red flags from the current website:</p><ul><li>High character counts on navigation links and subheadings</li><li>Removed any redundant headings and labels, making the content it conveyed more apparent</li><li>Produced consistent tone, voice, and wording across calls-to-action and labels</li></ul><p>Moving on from this, I&rsquo;ll discuss how I incorporated cognitive and social psychological aspects into my designs.</p><h3 id=cognitive-and-social-psychology>Cognitive and Social Psychology</h3><p>In my post on <a href=/user%20experience%20design/2016/04/03/cognitive-social-psychology/#cognitive-psychology>cognitive and social psychology</a>, I spoke about reducing cognitive load by making information easier to digest using a combination of media and text - here&rsquo;s an example of that in the design solution:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-17-high-fidelity-solution/Reducing-cognitive-load.png alt="Reducing cognitive load"><figcaption>Reducing cognitive load</figcaption></p><p>Above we can also see linking to the venue that the event is being held in, appealing to people&rsquo;s want to cut corners in common workflows.</p><p>We also see the social psychological concept of scarcity taking effect - showing how many tickets are remaining may persuade the target audience to act quickly and purchase a ticket themselves!</p><p>Seeing just how many people you know are attending the event may sway you to attend yourself, so the concept of social proof comes into play at the bottom of any events details page:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-17-high-fidelity-solution/Social-proof-contrast.png alt="Social proof and contrast load"><figcaption>Social proof and contrast</figcaption></p><p>The use of contrast in both colour and size for the event tracking and buying buttons makes the buying call-to-action more attractive.</p><p>Lastly I&rsquo;ll touch on universal (inclusive) design and accessibility, and how I took the research I did in this area into my final designs.</p><h3 id=universal-design-and-accessibility>Universal design and accessibility</h3><p>As discussed in my <a href=/user%20experience%20design/2016/04/10/universal-inclusive-design-accessibility/#equitable-use>post on this topic</a>, I&rsquo;ve made considerations for a number of principles of universal design:</p><ul><li>Equitable use</li><li>Flexibility in use</li><li>Simple and intuitive use</li><li>Size and space for approach and use</li></ul><p>To validate my proposed solution for equitable use, I tested my designs against different levels of colour blindness. One of the most challenging was tritanopia, an extremely rare condition that renders blue and green almost indistinguishable. The colour palette I developed above provides what I feel is enough of a noticeable distinction between actions:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-17-high-fidelity-solution/Tritanopia-comparison.png alt="Tritanopia comparison"><figcaption>Tritanopia comparison</figcaption></p><p>To demonstrate flexibility in use, I produced filtering controls that would provide the target audience choice in the methods that they used for discovering upcoming events, which they could do at their own pace:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-17-high-fidelity-solution/Filter-panel.png alt="Filter panel"><figcaption>Filter panel</figcaption></p><p>With regards to simple and intuitive use, the filters above illustrate the flexibility of manipulating the event listings depending on the options they select. There are also multiple avenues of navigation between artist, event, and venue:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-17-high-fidelity-solution/Navigation.png alt=Navigation><figcaption>Navigation</figcaption></p><p>Finally, for size and space for approach and use I looked at adding key actions like filtering closer to the user&rsquo;s hand. As well as this, consideration was made for the user&rsquo;s comfort, with no touch target being shorter than 40 pixels in width or height.</p><p>With the prototype finished, it&rsquo;s now time to see it in action - Here&rsquo;s a <a href=http://adobe.ly/1VAFHbh target=_blank>link</a> to the high-fidelity solution I produced!</p><h3 id=next-steps>Next steps</h3><p>In my final post, I&rsquo;ll discuss the usability testing I designed and conducted for this prototype, and how the results received could inform my designs.</p><h3 id=resources>Resources</h3><ul><li><a href=https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html target=_blank>Google material design</a></li><li><a href=http://adobe.ly/1VAFHbh target=_blank>High-fidelity solution</a></li><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FfljBzfQCazBGK0SXLC3GUzNUsXIMgyWoQ" target=_blank>User flow</a></li></ul><footer><div class=previous-post><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/04/10/universal-inclusive-design-accessibility/" title="Universal (inclusive) design and accessibility">Previous post</a></div></footer></article></main><aside><h3>Posts</h3><ol class=posts><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/04/17/high-fidelity-solution/" title="Apr 17, 2016">High-fidelity solution</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/04/10/universal-inclusive-design-accessibility/" title="Apr 10, 2016">Universal (inclusive) design and accessibility</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/04/03/cognitive-social-psychology/" title="Apr 3, 2016">Cognitive and social psychology</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/27/information-architecture-content-strategy/" title="Mar 27, 2016">Information Architecture and Content Strategy</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/20/gaining-empathy/" title="Mar 20, 2016">Gaining Empathy</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/13/design-languages-pattern-libraries/" title="Mar 13, 2016">Design Languages and Pattern Libraries</a></li><li><a href="/user%20experience%20design/2016/03/06/introduction/" title="Mar 6, 2016">Introduction</a></li></ol><h3>Links</h3><ul class=links><li><a href=http://github.com/simonfinney target=_blank>GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzA9UyHASmcNRjFEWjltV3M5cEE&usp=sharing" target=_blank>Google Drive</a></li><li><a href=http://twitter.com/SimonJFinney target=_blank>Twitter</a></li></ul></aside><script src=/assets/javascript/main.min.6a32ec35.js></script></body></html>
