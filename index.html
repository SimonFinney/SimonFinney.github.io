However an interface is designed can significantly affect how well someone can learn mental models and remember how to carry out everyday tasks.</p><p>The wise Don Norman describes how people do things as the Seven Stages of Action:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-03-cognitive-social-psychology/Seven-Stages-of-Action.gif alt="Seven Stages of Action"><figcaption>Seven Stages of Action</figcaption></p><p>While this is illustrated as a linear path, the truth is that most humans don&rsquo;t behave that way - Most of the time, our goals are opportunistic rather than planned, and we&rsquo;re constantly responding to events happening all around us (Norman, 1988).</p><p>How then can we ensure that our target audiences aren&rsquo;t held back from achieving their goals by being completely and utterly overwhelmed by our interfaces?</p><p>In an effort to give non-psychologists a view into the science and how it informs design, Susan Weinschenk (2010) has applied knowledge and research from her trade to develop an well-informed <a href=https://uxmag.com/articles/the-psychologists-view-of-ux-design target=_blank>set of guiding principles</a>.</p><p>In it, Weinschenk talks about how people have limitations, in that they only read so much text on the screen before losing interest.</p><p>When we look at all of the events on <a href=http://www.tickets.ie/events.aspx target=_blank>Tickets.ie</a>, we see that there <em>probably</em> wasn&rsquo;t a whole lot of consideration for cognitive load, and making the information easier to scan.</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-03-cognitive-social-psychology/Tickets.ie_Cognitive-psychology.png alt="People Have Limitations - Problem"><figcaption>People Have Limitations - Problem</figcaption></p><p>It may have been a better approach to structure the event information in more digestible manner, providing some media to make each listing easier to consume:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-03-cognitive-social-psychology/Cognitive-psychology.jpg alt="People Have Limitations - Solution"><figcaption>People Have Limitations - Solution</figcaption></p><p>Vanessa Carey (2011) elaborates on Weinschenk&rsquo;s work, in which she establishes that people are inherently lazy and don&rsquo;t want to think or work more than they have to - I think we&rsquo;ve all been guilty of that at some stage!</p><p>That aside, Vanessa speaks to how people like shortcuts that cater to common workflows and how anything clickable should look clickable.</p><p>In it&rsquo;s early form, the low-fidelity sketch above also accounts for someone being able to navigate to an artist&rsquo;s biography or venue information if required, wherein the current website this wasn&rsquo;t completely possible.</p><p>While the above suggestions will deal with reducing the cognitive load, it doesn&rsquo;t deal with fully engaging the audience in using the application - This is something that social psychology can help us with.</p><h3>Social psychology</h3><p>Social proofing is a psychological sensation in which people guide their own behaviours by referencing the behaviour of those around them (Cardello, 2014).</p><p>In summary of her article, it&rsquo;s possible for us to represent the actions of a crowd to influence the behaviour and thoughts of our audience through our designs.</p><p>Spencer Lanoue (2015) outlines six principles that can influence and persuade people to engage with a product and take some form of action:</p><ol><li>*<em>Reciprocation - *</em> Providing something useful illicits a return favour</li><li>*<em>Social Proof - *</em> When uncertain, people go with the crowd</li><li>*<em>Scarcity - *</em> People tend to want what they can&rsquo;t have</li><li>*<em>Framing - *</em> When making an important decision, people compare</li><li>*<em>Salience - *</em> Attention is drawn to relevance</li><li>*<em>Contrast - *</em> Something that stands out is remembered the most</li></ol><p>When looking for some social elements on Tickets.ie, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a whole lot:</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-03-cognitive-social-psychology/Tickets.ie_Social-psychology.png alt="Social psychology - Problem"><figcaption>Social psychology - Problem</figcaption></p><p>Sure, users can post this artist on their favourite social networks in an attempt at internet peacocking - but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like there&rsquo;s been any thought into how social proofing can be leveraged to persuade them to engage with it and purchase tickets.</p><blockquote><p>People will always try to use technology to be social</p></blockquote><p>Yes, people are social (Weinschenk, 2010), so we should let them be! According to Rogers et al. (2012), the most important aspect of socialising is being aware of what others are doing and letting others know what you&rsquo;re doing yourself.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a number of suggestions I&rsquo;ve made that incorporate these social triggers into my designs:</p><p>With reciprocation, our users could be offered a chance to win tickets for the event, or to track it, in exchange for creating an account with us.</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-03-cognitive-social-psychology/Reciprocation.jpg alt="Social psychology - Reciprocation"><figcaption>Social psychology - Reciprocation</figcaption></p><p>To piggyback off social influence, the application&rsquo;s audience can see just who&rsquo;s attending the event, including those they&rsquo;re friends with on social media.</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-03-cognitive-social-psychology/Social-Proof.jpg alt="Social psychology - Social Proof"><figcaption>Social psychology - Social Proof</figcaption></p><p>The final redesign could include an indicator showing exactly how many tickets are left for the event, so depending on how scarce they&rsquo;re becoming the user may act quickly to make sure they don&rsquo;t miss out!</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-03-cognitive-social-psychology/Scarcity.jpg alt="Social psychology - Scarcity"><figcaption>Social psychology - Scarcity</figcaption></p><p>Depending on what our audience has already viewed, artist&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re interested in, and even they&rsquo;re current location, salience can be applied to surface events that are most relevant to them, increasing chance of purchase.</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-03-cognitive-social-psychology/Salience.jpg alt="Social psychology - Salience"><figcaption>Social psychology - Salience</figcaption></p><p>Finally, contrast can be applied to most important calls-to-action for ticket vendors, such as the action of buying a ticket, to make them stand out and catch the eyes of the audience.</p><p><img src=/assets/images/2016-04-03-cognitive-social-psychology/Contrast.jpg alt="Social psychology - Contrast"><figcaption>Social psychology - Contrast</figcaption></p><p>Keeping all of these social principles in mind when developing designs will greatly improve the ability to influence and persuade individuals using any application (Lanoue, 2015) - as I move from sketches into higher fidelity mockups, we&rsquo;ll be able to see these concepts further take shape.</p><h3>Next steps</h3><p>In my next post, I&rsquo;m going to examine concepts and principles of universal design (inclusive design) and accessibility to see how they can be applied to my final designs.</p><h3>References</h3><ul><li>Cardello, J.
