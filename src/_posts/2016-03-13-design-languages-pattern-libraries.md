Today I had a look at examples of some <a href="http://styleguides.io/examples.html" target="_blank">design languages and pattern libraries</a>, in an attempt to understand what's currently out there, and adopt some of their practices to begin shaping the tone of voice and overall character of the project.

Those that resonated with me the most were the following:

- MailChimp <a href="http://styleguide.mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">Content Style Guide</a> and <a href="http://voiceandtone.com/" target="_blank">Voice & Tone</a>
- <a href="https://issuu.com/janjaneczek/docs/spotify" target="_blank">Spotify Identity Manual</a>
- <a href="http://www.yelp.com/styleguide" target="_blank">Yelp Styleguide</a>

### MailChimp Content Style Guide and Voice & Tone

The content style guide and voice and tone guidelines from MailChimp is excellent and goes into much depth on a lot of subjects. It's main takeaways appear to be their definition of good content, which according to them is:

- Appropriate
- Clear
- Friendly
- Useful

Reading through their guidelines on grammar and mechanics, I came across an important tip for writing content which resonated with me:

> When in doubt, read your writing out loud

It sounds straight-forward, but I can see it being true. As long as there's established principles and you read your content aloud, you'll be able to determine whether it's casting the right mood or not.

MailChimp's voice and tone is also confident, informative, and casually engages their customers, providing encouragement and a sense of accomplishment once any task has been completed. Full of hidden delight, they're also not afraid to throw a bit of humour into the mix!

After looking through what MailChimp has to offer, I've decided to follow a similar approach and remain casual, but informative, as well as nd human when engaging the user in my designs.

### Yelp Styleguide

While Yelp's styleguide doesn't contain a whole lot of detail regarding how to write content, it provides good insight and usage guidelines for patterns and visual elements used across the application, like typography, colour, and layout, as well as components such as buttons, form controls, and links.

Everything Yelp has documented appears clear, simple, and fit for purpose. The colour palette is minimal but just the right amount of fun, without distracting from the application's primary experience.

I'm going to play by Yelp's example moving forward, and apply bright, clear, and engaging aesthetics to my designs without distracting the user from their task at hand.

### Prototyping and visual design tools

I've also been researching a number of prototyping and visual design tools, in particular <a href="http://www.adobe.com/ie/products/experience-design.html" target="_blank">Adobe Experience Design CC</a>, <a href="http://framerjs.com/" target="_blank">Framer</a>, and <a href="https://proto.io/" target="_blank">proto.io</a>.

As Adobe Experience Design is fresh to the market, I figured I'd use this opportunity to really put it to the test. It provides the ability to design and prototype interactive applications (similar to <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">Sketch</a> and <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank">InVision</a>) from scratch using the familiarity of Creative Cloud's toolset, with the option for live previews and simple sharing. It also looks to integrate with Adobe Illustrator, something I'm not up-to-scratch with and always wanted to improve my skills in, to import higher-quality assets.

While Framer and proto.io seem to have a good support for dynamic elements, maybe more so than Adobe Experience Design, their learning curves seemed far higher in comparison.

### Next steps

In the next post, I'll look at gaining empathy for those exposed to the current experience - The tasks covered will include proto-personas, identifying any current issues, experience mapping, and storyboarding.
