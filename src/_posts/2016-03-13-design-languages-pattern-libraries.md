I've also been researching a number of prototyping and visual design tools, in particular <a href="http://www.adobe.com/ie/products/experience-design.html" target="_blank">Adobe Experience Design CC</a>, <a href="http://framerjs.com/" target="_blank">Framer</a>, and <a href="https://proto.io/" target="_blank">proto.io</a>.

As Adobe Experience Design is fresh to the market, I figured I'd use this opportunity to really put it to the test. It provides the ability to design and prototype interactive applications (similar to <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">Sketch</a> and <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank">InVision</a>) from scratch using the familiarity of Creative Cloud's toolset, with the option for live previews and simple sharing. It also looks to integrate with Adobe Illustrator, something I'm not up-to-scratch with and always wanted to improve my skills in, to import higher-quality assets.

While Framer and proto.io seem to have a good support for dynamic elements, maybe more so than Adobe Experience Design, their learning curves seemed much higher in comparison.

In the next post, I'll look at gaining empathy for those exposed to the current experience - The tasks covered will include proto-personas, identifying the current issues, experience mapping, and storyboarding.
