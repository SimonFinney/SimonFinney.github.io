When deciding on what to focus on, I wanted to concentrate on designing something that I was interested in and passionate about, and address a need that would impact my life for the better.

As a music lover, I try to attend as many gigs around the city as I can in my free time, but have a hard time keeping tracking of what's on tonight and where, what's coming up soon, and what's coming into town in the future.

Unfortunately, there's no single point of truth for me when it comes to discovering gigs that may be on the horizon, and I find that I have to use a combination of a number of different websites (<a href="http://entertainment.ie/music/listings/" target="_blank">entertainment.ie</a>, <a href="http://www.nme.com/tickets/city/dublin" target="_blank">NME</a>, and <a href="http://www.tickets.ie/" target="_blank">Tickets.ie</a> to name just a few), social networks, along with word-of-mouth to get the job done and find the information I need.

Here's some samples outlining the lack of customisability, flexibility and variety of information my current means provide:

As a result of this problem, I've decided to examine some of the ways I currently employ when searching for gigs to attend, and design a solution in the form of a high-fidelity interactive prototype, by applying knowledge from a wide variety of areas, including:

- Psychology, in particular the cognitive, emotional, perceptual, and social aspects of it
- Content strategy and information architecture
- Accessibility and inclusive design

As well as looking at the above areas, throughout the course of the next month, I'll conduct the following tasks in an effort to improve the overall gig-finding experience:

- Develop proto-personas and scenarios
- Research a number of design languages, and pattern libraries, integrating a common framework into the application
- Conduct usability testing to evaluate my designs in an iterative manner


After much deliberation on choosing a platform (<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a>, or <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>), I decided to use Jekyll and host it on GitHub Pages as, while the setup was more complicated than the other platforms to get started, it provided me with greater flexibility to customise the layout, handles higher levels of traffic, and also provided the opportunity to open source blog's code on GitHub for anyone to fork and contribute to.

Overviewing a few project management tools to use (<a href="https://asana.com/" target="_blank">Asana</a>, and <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">GitHub Issues</a>), I decided that as I'll be working on my own, the use of these would be overkill. As a result, I've created a project plan which can be accessed <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cslYNdrI2uEUQJJxMyQ1FbJkkaDBW0eMrTyV0VlHwAM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. This outlines both the research and tasks I intend on conducting over the course of the next month, along with some provisional dates in place to ensure I remain on track.

In the next post, I'll discuss some of the pattern libraries, and style guides I'll be researching, as well as the prototype and visual design platforms I'll be using.
