For this post, I spent some time dissecting the current state of gig listing, by identifying problems in what's currently available. I also had a look at creating a rough persona for the project, Eoin, as a means of quickly building empathy, and developing a scenario in which they might use the product.

### Pain points

As someone who has to pro-actively figure out what's on throughout

- Shows are spread across different outlets/retailers and can be missed easily if they're all not checked
- There's little filtering available - You can only filter down by one genre at a time, and there's no way to filter by date or by location effectively
- There's currently no way to discover what's near me based on my interests or location
- There's no way to easily set up alerts or reminders for when something that might interest me appears


### Meet Eoin

Eoin is the sole persona for this need, and he is representing someone who would use the product casually and on-the-spot when he's looking for something to do.

The persona was generated rapidly over a period of an hour using an <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/themes/dschool/method-cards/empathy-map.pdf" target="_blank">empathy map</a> exercise, as a means of quickly placing myself in my user's shoes and discover their pains and opportunities.
