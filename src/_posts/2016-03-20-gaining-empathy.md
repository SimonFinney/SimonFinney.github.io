For this post, I spent some time dissecting the current state of gig listing, by identifying problems in what's currently available. I also had a look at creating a rough persona for the project, Eoin, as a means of quickly building empathy, and developing a scenario in which they might use the product.

### Pain points

As someone who has to pro-actively figure out what's on throughout

- Shows are spread across different outlets/retailers and can be missed easily if they're all not checked
- There's little filtering available - You can only filter down by one genre at a time, and there's no way to filter by date or by location effectively
- There's currently no way to discover what's near me based on my interests or location
- There's no way to easily set up alerts or reminders for when something that might interest me appears


### Meet Eoin

Eoin is the sole persona for this need, and he is representing someone who would use the product casually and on-the-spot when he's looking for something to do.

The persona was generated rapidly over a period of an hour using an <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/themes/dschool/method-cards/empathy-map.pdf" target="_blank">empathy map</a> exercise, as a means of quickly placing myself in my user's shoes and discover their pains and opportunities.

### Storyboarding and scenario development

From here I used storyboarding as a means of understanding the current scenario better:

1. Eoin's boarding a bus on his way home from work on a Friday evening and he's hoping to do something one night over the weekend
2. Once he manages to get a seat, he takes his phone out and begins looking for gigs on tonight
3. He opens up a number of different things - social networks to see if his friends are attending anything, and ticketing website he frequently accesses to get a fuller picture of what's going on
4. When he's looking through the websites, he has to navigate through each of the categories one-by-one, wishing there was a better way to do this
5. With so much happening across the country, he's only really interested in what's happening in the city, and only the bands he'd care about
6. When he does eventually find something he might be interested in, he discovers it's sold out! He's annoyed he didn't find out about that sooner, otherwise he would've went
