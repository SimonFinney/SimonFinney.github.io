Why aren&rsquo;t category and subcategories just filtering options?</li><li>You can access an event from an artist&rsquo;s or venue&rsquo;s details, but not the other way around - This leaves dead ends within the navigation structure!</li></ol><p>The current website does a great job at listing everything that&rsquo;s on, and sorting by event, venue, or date and time, but if you&rsquo;re looking for anything else you&rsquo;re out of luck - Most people don&rsquo;t know exactly what they&rsquo;re looking for or even how to search for it (Morville et al., 2015).</p><p>In an attempt to alleviate the above issues, I created an <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_85mJzVulVh-y-VSwFGFVVzjPVKyz00ouQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updated high-level architecture sitemap</a>. Instead of forcing those who are browsing for events down a funnel with no return, the updated sitemap conveys the idea that someone can manipulate the event listings purely by toggling on and off options of their choice.</p><p><img src="/images/2016-03-27-information-architecture-content-strategy/Information-architecture.jpg" alt="Information architecture"></p><figcaption>Information architecture</figcaption><p></p><p>After developing a proposed sitemap for my designs, I made an attempt at deconstructing the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RkLuzMdiFI6pFTV3tAWfy5JzLK2fJIKnDQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">current content model</a> and rebuilding it again. According to Morville et al. (2015), content models help ensure that different pieces of content are linked together in meaningful ways to provide maximum value to those using the product.</p><p>Before, every piece of content such as event listings, artists, and venues, flowed in a single direction towards an event with little connection.</p><p>After critiquing the content model of the current website, I was able to devise a solution that allowed for bidirectional flow between each piece of content, maximising the value that could be provided, and unifying the navigation for the better.</p><p>From a psychological aspect, a potential social element could allow those using it to see who else is attanding, so I devised the draft content model to reflect this.</p><p>From here, the natural next step seemed to be to take a bottom-up approach and develop an entity relationship diagram for each of these pieces of content. This allowed me to evaluate the metadata on the current website and then expand on it, to help determine what could be browsed, filtered, indexed, and linked in the application.</p><p>With a foundation of the different kinds of content and how it&rsquo;s interconnected, I was now able to develop a content strategy behind it.</p><h3 id="content-strategy">Content strategy</h3><p>Although, the main purpose of the application is to discover and find upcoming events, it&rsquo;s important to note that consistent and engaging content can contribute greatly to the overall user experience.</p><p>According to Kissane (2011), good content is all of the below:</p><ul><li>Appropriate</li><li>Useful</li><li>User-centered</li><li>Clear</li><li>Consistent</li><li>Concise</li></ul><p>Content strategy is both a nuanced and multifaceted practice, with many possibilities (Bloomstein, 2012). A solid content strategy can help organisations produce content their audiences really need, and develop a sustainable, long-term publishing plan (Kissane, 2011).</p><p>For the scope of this project, I wanted to focus on how I could effectively reconcile all of the content on Tickets.ie, so the tone of the final designs remained consistent and meaningful to the application&rsquo;s audience throughout.</p><p>I began with an exercise in establishing a message archicture via a quick <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzA9UyHASmcNN3AxRVRsclV0XzQ&usp=sharing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">card sorting exercise</a>. Using only a few materials, I started to describe everything I felt the redesigns brand should offer, as well as what the audience&rsquo;s needs were for the product.</p><p><img src="/images/2016-03-27-information-architecture-content-strategy/Message-architecture.jpg" alt="Message architecture"></p><figcaption>Message architecture</figcaption><p></p><p>Once everything was laid out, I started clustering ideas and keywords that were similar until they were distilled and sat in the middle. From here I was able to develop some key overlapping points to carry through that I felt strongly reflected both the brand and audience needs, which would be used as a guide when producing content for the redesign:</p><ul><li>Approachable, friendly, and informal</li><li>Consistent and modern</li><li>Reliable and trusted</li><li>Efficient and flexible</li><li>Current and tailored</li></ul><p>The next step I took was to traverse through the current website and perform a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CeML0_uEil-w-kM94HQg14zjiE_zuyzQ9Tv-YYDUjRU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">core sample content audit</a> on the specific areas I&rsquo;m going to focus on. This included critiquing the website&rsquo;s headings, subheadings, fields, labels, and body copy against appropriateness, relevancy, and character count to understand where improvements were to be made.</p><p>Some of the key insights from the content audit include the following for addressing:</p><p>There was a number of high character counts littered around the website, particularly on navigation links and subheadings.</p><p><img src="/images/2016-03-27-information-architecture-content-strategy/Core-content-audit_1-3.png" alt="Core content audit - High character counts"></p><figcaption>Core content audit- High character counts</figcaption><p></p><p>Throughout the artists, events, and venue pages there was redundant headings and labels, with some of these being truncated in certain places.</p><p><img src="/images/2016-03-27-information-architecture-content-strategy/Core-content-audit_2-3.png" alt="Core content audit - Redundancy"></p><figcaption>Core content audit - Redundancy</figcaption><p></p><p>Finally, calls-to-action were inconsistent with each other, both in styling and wording.</p><p><img src="/images/2016-03-27-information-architecture-content-strategy/Core-content-audit_3-3.png" alt="Core content audit - Inconsistency"></p><figcaption>Core content audit - Inconsistency</figcaption><p></p><p>Using the message architecture as a guide and as I move into developing the design, I&rsquo;ll address these issues discovered in the core content audit to provide the application with a consistent feel, and tone of voice.</p><h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3><p>In the next post, I&rsquo;ll look at whether cognitive and social psychological principles are present in the current website, and leverage them to further improve the experience.</p><h3 id="references">References</h3><ul><li>Bloomstein, M.
