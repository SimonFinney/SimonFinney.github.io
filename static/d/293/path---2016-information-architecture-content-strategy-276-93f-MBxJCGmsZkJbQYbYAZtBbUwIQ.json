Why\naren't category and subcategories just filtering options?</li>\n<li>You can access an event from an artist's or venue's details, but not the\nother way around - This leaves dead ends within the navigation structure!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The current website does a great job at listing everything that's on, and\nsorting by event, venue, or date and time, but if you're looking for anything\nelse you're out of luck - Most people don't know exactly what they're looking\nfor or even how to search for it (Morville et al., 2015).</p>\n<p>In an attempt to alleviate the above issues, I created an\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_85mJzVulVh-y-VSwFGFVVzjPVKyz00ouQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">updated high-level architecture sitemap</a>.\nInstead of forcing those who are browsing for events down a funnel with no\nreturn, the updated sitemap conveys the idea that someone can manipulate the\nevent listings purely by toggling on and off options of their choice.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/information-architecture-content-strategy/Information-architecture.jpg\" alt=\"Information architecture\"></p>\n<figcaption>Information architecture</figcaption>\n<p>After developing a proposed sitemap for my designs, I made an attempt at\ndeconstructing the\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RkLuzMdiFI6pFTV3tAWfy5JzLK2fJIKnDQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">current content model</a>\nand rebuilding it again. According to Morville et al. (2015), content models\nhelp ensure that different pieces of content are linked together in meaningful\nways to provide maximum value to those using the product.</p>\n<p>Before, every piece of content such as event listings, artists, and venues,\nflowed in a single direction towards an event with little connection.</p>\n<p>After critiquing the content model of the current website, I was able to devise\na solution that allowed for bidirectional flow between each piece of content,\nmaximising the value that could be provided, and unifying the navigation for the\nbetter.</p>\n<p>From a psychological aspect, a potential social element could allow those using\nit to see who else is attanding, so I devised the draft content model to reflect\nthis.</p>\n<p>From here, the natural next step seemed to be to take a bottom-up approach and\ndevelop an entity relationship diagram for each of these pieces of content. This\nallowed me to evaluate the metadata on the current website and then expand on\nit, to help determine what could be browsed, filtered, indexed, and linked in\nthe application.</p>\n<p>With a foundation of the different kinds of content and how it's interconnected,\nI was now able to develop a content strategy behind it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"content-strategy\"><a href=\"#content-strategy\" aria-label=\"content strategy permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Content strategy</h2>\n<p>Although, the main purpose of the application is to discover and find upcoming\nevents, it's important to note that consistent and engaging content can\ncontribute greatly to the overall user experience.</p>\n<p>According to Kissane (2011), good content is all of the below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appropriate</li>\n<li>Useful</li>\n<li>User-centered</li>\n<li>Clear</li>\n<li>Consistent</li>\n<li>Concise</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Content strategy is both a nuanced and multifaceted practice, with many\npossibilities (Bloomstein, 2012). A solid content strategy can help\norganisations produce content their audiences really need, and develop a\nsustainable, long-term publishing plan (Kissane, 2011).</p>\n<p>For the scope of this project, I wanted to focus on how I could effectively\nreconcile all of the content on Tickets.ie, so the tone of the final designs\nremained consistent and meaningful to the application's audience throughout.</p>\n<p>I began with an exercise in establishing a message archicture via a quick\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzA9UyHASmcNN3AxRVRsclV0XzQ&#x26;usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">card sorting exercise</a>.\nUsing only a few materials, I started to describe everything I felt the\nredesigns brand should offer, as well as what the audience's needs were for the\nproduct.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/information-architecture-content-strategy/Message-architecture.jpg\" alt=\"Message architecture\"></p>\n<figcaption>Message architecture</figcaption>\n<p>Once everything was laid out, I started clustering ideas and keywords that were\nsimilar until they were distilled and sat in the middle. From here I was able to\ndevelop some key overlapping points to carry through that I felt strongly\nreflected both the brand and audience needs, which would be used as a guide when\nproducing content for the redesign:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Approachable, friendly, and informal</li>\n<li>Consistent and modern</li>\n<li>Reliable and trusted</li>\n<li>Efficient and flexible</li>\n<li>Current and tailored</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next step I took was to traverse through the current website and perform a\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CeML0_uEil-w-kM94HQg14zjiE_zuyzQ9Tv-YYDUjRU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">core sample content audit</a>\non the specific areas I'm going to focus on. This included critiquing the\nwebsite's headings, subheadings, fields, labels, and body copy against\nappropriateness, relevancy, and character count to understand where improvements\nwere to be made.</p>\n<p>Some of the key insights from the content audit include the following for\naddressing:</p>\n<p>There was a number of high character counts littered around the website,\nparticularly on navigation links and subheadings.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/information-architecture-content-strategy/Core-content-audit_1-3.png\" alt=\"Core content audit - High character counts\"></p>\n<figcaption>Core content audit- High character counts</figcaption>\n<p>Throughout the artists, events, and venue pages there was redundant headings and\nlabels, with some of these being truncated in certain places.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/information-architecture-content-strategy/Core-content-audit_2-3.png\" alt=\"Core content audit - Redundancy\"></p>\n<figcaption>Core content audit - Redundancy</figcaption>\n<p>Finally, calls-to-action were inconsistent with each other, both in styling and\nwording.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/information-architecture-content-strategy/Core-content-audit_3-3.png\" alt=\"Core content audit - Inconsistency\"></p>\n<figcaption>Core content audit - Inconsistency</figcaption>\n<p>Using the message architecture as a guide and as I move into developing the\ndesign, I'll address these issues discovered in the core content audit to\nprovide the application with a consistent feel, and tone of voice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\"><a href=\"#next-steps\" aria-label=\"next steps permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Next steps</h2>\n<p>In the next post, I'll look at whether cognitive and social psychological\nprinciples are present in the current website, and leverage them to further\nimprove the experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bloomstein, M.
