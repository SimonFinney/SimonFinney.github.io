designing something that I was interested in and passionate\nabout, and to also address a need that could impact my life for the better in\nsome way or another.</p>\n<p>As a music lover, I try to attend as many gigs around the city as I can in my\nfree time, but have a hard time keeping tracking of what's on tonight and where,\nwhat's coming up soon, and what's coming into town in the future.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there's no single point of truth for me when it comes to\ndiscovering gigs that may be on the horizon, and I find that I have to use a\ncombination of a number of different websites\n(<a href=\"http://entertainment.ie/music/listings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">entertainment.ie</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.nme.com/tickets/city/dublin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NME</a>, and\n<a href=\"http://www.tickets.ie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tickets.ie</a> to name just a few), social networks, along\nwith word-of-mouth to get the job done and find the information I need.</p>\n<p>Here's some samples outlining the lack of customisability, flexibility and\nvariety of information my current means provide:</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/introduction/entertainment.ie.png\" alt=\"entertainment.ie\"></p>\n<figcaption>entertainment.ie</figcaption>\n<p><img

alt=\"Tickets.ie\"></p>\n<figcaption>Tickets.ie</figcaption>\n<p>As a result of this issue, I've decided to examine some of the ways I currently\nemploy when searching for gigs to attend, and design a solution in the form of a\nhigh-fidelity interactive prototype, by applying knowledge from a wide variety\nof areas, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Psychology, in particular the cognitive, emotional, perceptual, and social\naspects of it</li>\n<li>Content strategy and information architecture</li>\n<li>Accessibility and inclusive design</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As well as looking at the above areas, throughout the course of the next month,\nI'll conduct the following tasks in an effort to improve the overall gig-finding\nexperience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Develop proto-personas and scenarios</li>\n<li>Research a number of design languages, and pattern libraries, integrating\nknowledge learned from this into the application</li>\n<li>Conduct usability testing to evaluate my designs in an iterative manner</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"blog-platform-and-project-management\"><a href=\"#blog-platform-and-project-management\" aria-label=\"blog platform and project management

deliberation on choosing a platform (<a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jekyll</a>,\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medium</a>, or <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WordPress</a>), I\ndecided to use Jekyll and host it on GitHub Pages as, while the setup was more\ncomplicated than the other platforms to get started, it provided me with greater\nflexibility to customise the layout, handles higher levels of traffic, and also\nprovided the opportunity to open source the blog's code on GitHub for anyone to\nfork and contribute to.</p>\n<p>Overviewing a few project management tools to use (<a href=\"https://asana.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Asana</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://guides.github.com/features/issues/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Issues</a>), I decided that\nas I'll be working on my own, the use of these would be overkill. As a result,\nI've created a project plan which can be accessed\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cslYNdrI2uEUQJJxMyQ1FbJkkaDBW0eMrTyV0VlHwAM/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.\nThis outlines both the research and tasks I intend on conducting over the course\nof the next month, along with some provisional dates in place to ensure I remain\non track.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\"><a href=\"#next-steps\" aria-label=\"next steps permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Next steps</h2>\n<p>In the next post, I'll discuss some of the design languages, and pattern\nlibraries I'll be researching, as well as the prototype and visual design\nplatforms I intend on using.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\"><a href=\"#resources\" aria-label=\"resources permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jekyll - Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cslYNdrI2uEUQJJxMyQ1FbJkkaDBW0eMrTyV0VlHwAM/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Project plan</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"6 March, 2016","title":"Introduction"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016/design-languages-pattern-libraries/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Design Languages and Pattern Libraries"}},"slug":"/2016/introduction/"}}
