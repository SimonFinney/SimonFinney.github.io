The list goes on (Rogers, Sharpe, &#x26; Preece, 2012)!\nHowever an interface is designed can significantly affect how well someone can\nlearn mental models and remember how to carry out everyday tasks.</p>\n<p>The wise Don Norman describes how people do things as the Seven Stages of\nAction:</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/cognitive-social-psychology/Seven-Stages-of-Action.gif\" alt=\"Seven Stages of Action\"></p>\n<figcaption>Seven Stages of Action</figcaption>\n<p>While this is illustrated as a linear path, the truth is that most humans don't\nbehave that way - Most of the time, our goals are opportunistic rather than\nplanned, and we're constantly responding to events happening all around us\n(Norman, 1988).</p>\n<p>How then can we ensure that our target audiences aren't held back from achieving\ntheir goals by being completely and utterly overwhelmed by our interfaces?</p>\n<p>In an effort to give non-psychologists a view into the science and how it\ninforms design, Susan Weinschenk (2010) has applied knowledge and research from\nher trade to develop an well-informed\n<a href=\"https://uxmag.com/articles/the-psychologists-view-of-ux-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">set of guiding principles</a>.</p>\n<p>In it, Weinschenk talks about how people have limitations, in that they only\nread so much text on the screen before losing interest.</p>\n<p>When we look at all of the events on\n<a href=\"http://www.tickets.ie/events.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tickets.ie</a>, we see that there <em>probably</em>\nwasn't a whole lot of consideration for cognitive load, and making the\ninformation easier to scan.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/cognitive-social-psychology/Tickets.ie_Cognitive-psychology.png\" alt=\"People Have Limitations - Problem\"></p>\n<figcaption>People Have Limitations - Problem</figcaption>\n<p>It may have been a better approach to structure the event information in more\ndigestible manner, providing some media to make each listing easier to consume:</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/cognitive-social-psychology/Cognitive-psychology.jpg\" alt=\"People Have Limitations - Solution\"></p>\n<figcaption>People Have Limitations - Solution</figcaption>\n<p>Vanessa Carey (2011) elaborates on Weinschenk's work, in which she establishes\nthat people are inherently lazy and don't want to think or work more than they\nhave to - I think we've all been guilty of that at some stage!</p>\n<p>That aside, Vanessa speaks to how people like shortcuts that cater to common\nworkflows and how anything clickable should look clickable.</p>\n<p>In it's early form, the low-fidelity sketch above also accounts for someone\nbeing able to navigate to an artist's biography or venue information if\nrequired, wherein the current website this wasn't completely possible.</p>\n<p>While the above suggestions will deal with reducing the cognitive load, it\ndoesn't deal with fully engaging the audience in using the application - This is\nsomething that social psychology can help us with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"social-psychology\"><a href=\"#social-psychology\" aria-label=\"social psychology permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Social psychology</h2>\n<p>Social proofing is a psychological sensation in which people guide their own\nbehaviours by referencing the behaviour of those around them (Cardello, 2014).</p>\n<p>In summary of her article, it's possible for us to represent the actions of a\ncrowd to influence the behaviour and thoughts of our audience through our\ndesigns.</p>\n<p>Spencer Lanoue (2015) outlines six principles that can influence and persuade\npeople to engage with a product and take some form of action:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Reciprocation -</strong> Providing something useful illicits a return favour</li>\n<li><strong>Social Proof -</strong> When uncertain, people go with the crowd</li>\n<li><strong>Scarcity -</strong> People tend to want what they can't have</li>\n<li><strong>Framing -</strong> When making an important decision, people compare</li>\n<li><strong>Salience -</strong> Attention is drawn to relevance</li>\n<li><strong>Contrast -</strong> Something that stands out is remembered the most</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When looking for some social elements on Tickets.ie, there doesn't seem to be a\nwhole lot:</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/cognitive-social-psychology/Tickets.ie_Social-psychology.png\" alt=\"Social psychology -

According\nto Rogers et al. (2012), the most important aspect of socialising is being aware\nof what others are doing and letting others know what you're doing yourself.</p>\n<p>Here's a number of suggestions I've made that incorporate these social triggers\ninto my designs:</p>\n<p>With reciprocation, our users could be offered a chance to win tickets for the\nevent, or to track it, in exchange for creating an account with us.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/cognitive-social-psychology/Reciprocation.jpg\" alt=\"Social psychology - Reciprocation\"></p>\n<figcaption>Social psychology - Reciprocation</figcaption>\n<p>To piggyback off social influence, the application's audience can see just who's\nattending the event, including those they're friends with on social media.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/cognitive-social-psychology/Social-Proof.jpg\" alt=\"Social psychology - Social Proof\"></p>\n<figcaption>Social psychology - Social Proof</figcaption>\n<p>The final redesign could include an indicator showing exactly how many tickets\nare left for the event, so depending on how scarce they're becoming the user may\nact quickly to make sure they don't miss out!</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/cognitive-social-psychology/Scarcity.jpg\" alt=\"Social psychology - Scarcity\"></p>\n<figcaption>Social psychology - Scarcity</figcaption>\n<p>Depending on what our audience has already viewed, artist's they're interested\nin, and even they're current location, salience can be applied to surface events\nthat are most relevant to them, increasing chance of purchase.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/cognitive-social-psychology/Salience.jpg\" alt=\"Social psychology - Salience\"></p>\n<figcaption>Social psychology - Salience</figcaption>\n<p>Finally, contrast can be applied to most important calls-to-action for ticket\nvendors, such as the action of buying a ticket, to make them stand out and catch\nthe eyes of the audience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/cognitive-social-psychology/Contrast.jpg\" alt=\"Social psychology - Contrast\"></p>\n<figcaption>Social psychology - Contrast</figcaption>\n<p>Keeping all of these social principles in mind when developing designs will\ngreatly improve the ability to influence and persuade individuals using any\napplication (Lanoue, 2015) - as I move from sketches into higher fidelity\nmockups, we'll be able to see these concepts further take shape.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\"><a href=\"#next-steps\" aria-label=\"next steps permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Next steps</h2>\n<p>In my next post, I'm going to examine concepts and principles of universal\ndesign (inclusive design) and accessibility to see how they can be applied to my\nfinal designs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-label=\"references permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Cardello, J.
