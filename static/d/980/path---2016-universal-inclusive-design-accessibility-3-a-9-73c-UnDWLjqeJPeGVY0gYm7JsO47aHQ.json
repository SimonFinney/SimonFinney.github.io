It's guidelines are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1a. Provide the same means of use for all users: identical whenever possible;\nequivalent when not</li>\n<li>1b. Avoid segregating or stigmatising any users</li>\n<li>1c. Provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally available\nto all users</li>\n<li>1d. Make the design appealing to all users</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently <a href=\"https://www.tickets.ie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tickets.ie</a> has a very limited colour palette\n(Numerous levels of grey and orange) which may not drastically affect users with\ncolour blindness. If we invert the colours, we can also see that it performs for\nthose sensitive to brightness, and easier to distinguish for those suffering\nfrom colour blindness:</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/universal-inclusive-design-accessibility/Tickets.ie_Equitable-Use.png\" alt=\"Equitable Use - Problem\"></p>\n<figcaption>Equitable Use - Problem</figcaption>\n<p>The most apparent issue lies in the distinguishability of links from other copy\non the website, although the persistent monochromatic tones may render certain\naspects of the website indistinguishable from others.</p>\n<p>We can see how <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/dublin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yelp</a> have accommodated for those\nwith deuteranopia, a common form of colour blindness, by integrating a limited\nbut effective colour palette to differentiate between different sections and\nnavigation elements.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/pages/universal-inclusive-design-accessibility/Yelp_Equitable-Use.png\" alt=\"Equitable Use - Solution\"></p>\n<figcaption>Equitable Use - Solution</figcaption>\n<p>The final design will address the above issues by providing clear\ndifferentiation between navigation and copy through the use of type, the\nassistance of iconography, and the use of contrasting colours to differentiate\nseparate sections.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flexibility-in-use\"><a href=\"#flexibility-in-use\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Flexibility in Use</h3>\n<p>Flexibility in use refers to a design accommodating a a wide range of individual\npreferences and abilities.

These varied from severe violations like how the structure\nof certain elements on the page would prevent screen readers from navigating\nsuccessfully throughout the content, to missing significant attributes on media\nand navigation elements that provide screen readers with valuable content\ndescriptions for those with visual impairments.</p>\n<p>If you’re not suffering from a colour vision deficiency, it can be pretty hard\nto imagine what it looks like to be colour blind. Visual impairments can vary in\nseverity, from colour vision deficiency which prevents those that live with it\nto identify change in colour (Miller, 2016), to those who can't discern any\ncontent, and rely on screen readers as their main interface with an application.</p>\n<p>While my final prototype will show a proof-of-concept and not go as far as fully\nengineering the application, below are a number of recommendations I've\nsuggested for improvement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Text alternatives should be provided for any non-text content</li>\n<li>Ensure semantic HTML document structure is provided to allow screen readers\nnavigate naturally throughout the document</li>\n<li>Make the contrast between colour of text and it's background distinguishable\nand legible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the last of considerations aside, I can continue with the design production\nprocess and finally start building!</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\"><a href=\"#next-steps\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Next steps</h2>\n<p>My final post will detail the production process of my design and prototype\nusing Adobe Illustrator and Experience Design - I'll walk through the typical\nflow for Eoin, our primary user, and incorporate all of the artifacts I've\nproduced so far.</p>\n<p>I'll also discuss the usability test I conducted to evaluate the prototype's\ndesign, along with any materials produced.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\"><a href=\"#references\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Cooper, M.
