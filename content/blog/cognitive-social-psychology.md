title: Cognitive and social psychology
description: Blog post outlining influential and motivating cognitive and social psychological principles applied to user experience design
---

This week I spent time researching cognitive and social psychological principles
applied to user experience design, and how it can factor in to influencing and
motivating someone in engaging with an application.

Then, using the principles below, I audited the current experience, developing
ideas as to how this would apply to the final design.

For this project, I focused on two aspects of psychology, cognitive and social,
in an effort to reduce cognitive load on those using the application and
persuade them to engage further, via social interaction.

## Cognitive psychology

There are many different kinds of cognition - decision making, learning,
remembering, thinking... The list goes on (Rogers, Sharpe, & Preece, 2012)!
However an interface is designed can significantly affect how well someone can
learn mental models and remember how to carry out everyday tasks.

The wise Don Norman describes how people do things as the Seven Stages of
Action:

While this is illustrated as a linear path, the truth is that most humans don't
behave that way - Most of the time, our goals are opportunistic rather than
planned, and we're constantly responding to events happening all around us
(Norman, 1988).

How then can we ensure that our target audiences aren't held back from achieving
their goals by being completely and utterly overwhelmed by our interfaces?

In an effort to give non-psychologists a view into the science and how it
informs design, Susan Weinschenk (2010) has applied knowledge and research from
her trade to develop an well-informed
[set of guiding principles](https://uxmag.com/articles/the-psychologists-view-of-ux-design).

In it, Weinschenk talks about how people have limitations, in that they only
read so much text on the screen before losing interest.

When we look at all of the events on
[Tickets.ie](http://www.tickets.ie/events.aspx), we see that there _probably_
wasn't a whole lot of consideration for cognitive load, and making the
information easier to scan.

It may have been a better approach to structure the event information in more
digestible manner, providing some media to make each listing easier to consume:

Vanessa Carey (2011) elaborates on Weinschenk's work, in which she establishes
that people are inherently lazy and don't want to think or work more than they
have to - I think we've all been guilty of that at some stage!

That aside, Vanessa speaks to how people like shortcuts that cater to common
workflows and how anything clickable should look clickable.

In it's early form, the low-fidelity sketch above also accounts for someone
being able to navigate to an artist's biography or venue information if
required, wherein the current website this wasn't completely possible.

While the above suggestions will deal with reducing the cognitive load, it
doesn't deal with fully engaging the audience in using the application - This is
something that social psychology can help us with.

## Social psychology

Social proofing is a psychological sensation in which people guide their own
behaviours by referencing the behaviour of those around them (Cardello, 2014).

In summary of her article, it's possible for us to represent the actions of a
crowd to influence the behaviour and thoughts of our audience through our
designs.

Spencer Lanoue (2015) outlines six principles that can influence and persuade
people to engage with a product and take some form of action:

1. **Reciprocation -** Providing something useful illicits a return favour
2. **Social Proof -** When uncertain, people go with the crowd
3. **Scarcity -** People tend to want what they can't have
4. **Framing -** When making an important decision, people compare
5. **Salience -** Attention is drawn to relevance
6. **Contrast -** Something that stands out is remembered the most

When looking for some social elements on Tickets.ie, there doesn't seem to be a
whole lot:

![Social psychology - Problem](../images/pages/cognitive-social-psychology/Tickets.ie_Social-psychology.png)

Sure, users can post this artist on their favourite social networks in an
attempt at internet peacocking - but it doesn't seem like there's been any
thought into how social proofing can be leveraged to persuade them to engage
with it and purchase tickets.

> People will always try to use technology to be social

Yes, people are social (Weinschenk, 2010), so we should let them be! According
to Rogers et al. (2012), the most important aspect of socialising is being aware
of what others are doing and letting others know what you're doing yourself.

Here's a number of suggestions I've made that incorporate these social triggers
into my designs:

With reciprocation, our users could be offered a chance to win tickets for the
event, or to track it, in exchange for creating an account with us.

![Social psychology - Reciprocation](../images/pages/cognitive-social-psychology/Reciprocation.jpg)

<figcaption>Social psychology - Reciprocation</figcaption>

To piggyback off social influence, the application's audience can see just who's
attending the event, including those they're friends with on social media.

The final redesign could include an indicator showing exactly how many tickets
are left for the event, so depending on how scarce they're becoming the user may
act quickly to make sure they don't miss out!

Depending on what our audience has already viewed, artist's they're interested
in, and even they're current location, salience can be applied to surface events
that are most relevant to them, increasing chance of purchase.

Finally, contrast can be applied to most important calls-to-action for ticket
vendors, such as the action of buying a ticket, to make them stand out and catch
the eyes of the audience.

Keeping all of these social principles in mind when developing designs will
greatly improve the ability to influence and persuade individuals using any
application (Lanoue, 2015) - as I move from sketches into higher fidelity
mockups, we'll be able to see these concepts further take shape.

## Next steps

In my next post, I'm going to examine concepts and principles of universal
design (inclusive design) and accessibility to see how they can be applied to my
final designs.
