title: Design Languages and Pattern Libraries
description: #
---

This week I was busy finalising set up for the platform I'll use to document and
host my work, as well as researching design languages and pattern libraries, and
prototype and visual design tools.

During this time, I had a look at examples of some
[design languages and pattern libraries](http://styleguides.io/examples.html),
in an attempt to understand what's currently out there, and adopt some of their
practices to begin shaping the tone of voice and overall character and mood of
the project.

Out of all of those I glanced through, the two I found most comprehensive and
intriguing were:

* MailChimp [Content Style Guide](http://styleguide.mailchimp.com/) and
  [Voice & Tone](http://voiceandtone.com/)
* [Yelp Styleguide](http://www.yelp.com/styleguide)

## MailChimp Content Style Guide and Voice & Tone

The content style guide and voice and tone guidelines from MailChimp is
excellent and goes into much depth on a lot of subjects. I found that the main
takeaways emphasised appear to be in their definition of good content, which
according to them is:

* Appropriate
* Clear
* Friendly
* Useful

Also, while reading through their guidelines on grammar and mechanics, I came
across a tip which resonated with me for writing content:

> When in doubt, read your writing out loud

It sounds straight-forward, but I can see this being useful and ringing true
throughout the course of the project. It seems like as long as there's some
established principles and content is read aloud, you'll be able to determine
whether it's casting the right mood or not.

MailChimp's voice and tone is also confident, informative, and casually engages
their customers, providing encouragement and a sense of accomplishment once any
task has been completed. It's full of hidden delight, and they're also not
afraid to throw a bit of humour into the mix!

After reading through what MailChimp has to offer, I've decided to follow a
similar approach and have drafted some content principles to keep in mind while
developing my designs:

* Light-hearted
* Informative
* Human
* To-the-point

While the wording of these is subject to change, it provides a manner to be
conscious of while designing.

## Yelp Styleguide

Unlike MailChimp, Yelp's styleguide doesn't contain a whole lot of detail
regarding how to write content, but it does it provide plenty of insight and
usage guidelines into patterns, both basic and complex, and visual elements such
as typography, colour, and layout.

The assets that Yelp has documented all appear clear, simple, and fit for
purpose. The colour palette they use is stripped-down to the very essentials but
contains just the right amount of fun, without getting in the way of
application's primary experience.

Moving forward, I'm going to play by Yelp's example, and apply bright, clear,
and engaging aesthetics to my designs without distracting the user from their
task at hand.

## Prototyping and visual design tools

I've also spent some time online researching a number of prototyping and visual
design tools to use, in particular
[Adobe Experience Design CC](http://www.adobe.com/ie/products/experience-design.html),
[Framer](http://framerjs.com/), and [proto.io](https://proto.io/).

As I already have experience with [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/)
and [InVision](http://www.invisionapp.com/), and as Experience Design is fresh
to the market, I figured I'd use this as an opportunity to really put it to the
test. It provides the ability to design and prototype interactive applications
from scratch using the familiarity of Creative Cloud's toolset, with the claim
of live previews and simple sharing. It also boasts integration with Adobe
Illustrator to import higher-quality assets, a tool I'm not up-to-scratch with
and had been looking for an opportunity to improve my skills in.

Though Framer and proto.io seem to have a good support for dynamic elements,
maybe more so than Adobe Experience Design, their learning curves seemed far
higher in comparison.

## Next steps

In the next post, I'll look at gaining empathy for those exposed to the current
gig-finding experience. The topics I'll cover will include proto-personas,
identifying any issues with the current scenario, and experience and scenario
mapping via storyboarding.
